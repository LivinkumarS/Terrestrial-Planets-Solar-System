            <h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="venus">
            <h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth's closest planetary neighbor. It's one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it's often called Earth's twin because it's similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.</p>

        <div class="earth">
            <h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. Earth is the only planet in the Solar System whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The name was taken from Old English and Germanic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mars">
            <h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is no place for the faint-hearted. It's dry, rocky, and bitter cold. The fourth planet from the Sun, Mars is one of Earth's two closest planetary neighbors (Venus is the other). Mars is one of the easiest planets to spot in the night sky – it looks like a bright red point of light.</p>
